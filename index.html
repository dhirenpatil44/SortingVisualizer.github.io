    <h1>
        1. Bubble Sort
    </h1>
    Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order. It is
    called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water.
    Bubbles in water rise up to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each
    iteration.

    Although it is simple to use, it is primarily used as an educational tool because the performance of bubble sort is
    poor in the real world. It is not suitable for large data sets. The average and worst-case complexity of Bubble sort
    is O(n2), where n is a number of items.

    <h1>
        2. Selection Sort
    </h1>

    In selection sort, the smallest value among the unsorted elements of the array is selected in every pass and
    inserted to its appropriate position into the array. It is also the simplest algorithm. It is an in-place comparison
    sorting algorithm. In this algorithm, the array is divided into two parts, first is sorted part, and another one is
    the unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part of the array is empty, and unsorted part is the given array. Sorted
    part is placed at the left, while the unsorted part is placed at the right.

    In selection sort, the first smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and placed at the first position.
    After that second smallest element is selected and placed in the second position. The process continues until the
    array is entirely sorted.

    The average and worst-case complexity of selection sort is O(n2), where n is the number of items. Due to this, it is
    not suitable for large data sets.
    </p>

    <h1>
        3. Insertion Sort
    </h1>

    Insertion sort works similar to the sorting of playing cards in hands. It is assumed that the first card is already
    sorted in the card game, and then we select an unsorted card. If the selected unsorted card is greater than the
    first card, it will be placed at the right side; otherwise, it will be placed at the left side. Similarly, all
    unsorted cards are taken and put in their exact place.

    The same approach is applied in insertion sort. The idea behind the insertion sort is that first take one element,
    iterate it through the sorted array. Although it is simple to use, it is not appropriate for large data sets as the
    time complexity of insertion sort in the average case and worst case is O(n2), where n is the number of items.
    Insertion sort is less efficient than the other sorting algorithms like heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, etc.

    <h1>
        4. Quick Sort
    </h1>
    Sorting is a way of arranging items in a systematic manner. Quicksort is the widely used sorting algorithm that
    makes n log n comparisons in average case for sorting an array of n elements. It is a faster and highly efficient
    sorting algorithm. This algorithm follows the divide and conquer approach. Divide and conquer is a technique of
    breaking down the algorithms into subproblems, then solving the subproblems, and combining the results back together
    to solve the original problem.

    Divide: In Divide, first pick a pivot element. After that, partition or rearrange the array into two sub-arrays such
    that each element in the left sub-array is less than or equal to the pivot element and each element in the right
    sub-array is larger than the pivot element.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h1>
        5. Merge Sort
    </h1>
    Merge sort is similar to the quick sort algorithm as it uses the divide and conquer approach to sort the elements.
    It is one of the most popular and efficient sorting algorithm. It divides the given list into two equal halves,
    calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. We have to define the merge() function to
    perform the merging.

    The sub-lists are divided again and again into halves until the list cannot be divided further. Then we combine the
    pair of one element lists into two-element lists, sorting them in the process. The sorted two-element pairs is
    merged into the four-element lists, and so on until we get the sorted list.
    </p>
